# BioGeography
## Using envirotyping data to assess population stucture

Using data from `WorldClim` repository and combining with genome admixture data, we will explore the population structure of a wild legume around the Mediterannean Basin.

To get ready for the tutorials, please download the following software/R packages to your local machine

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. R packages: [pegas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pegas/), [adegenet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/), [mmod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mmod/), [hierfstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hierfstat/), [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape), [mapplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapplots), [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools), [rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap)

## The example scripts for running the analyses can be found in the  sub-directories.
The genotypes and additonal data are provided in the ../data/ directory

You may download the repository as a zip file to your own machine and appropriate folder: Use **CODE / Download ZIP**. After extraction, all elements will be in place.  

Alternatively, you may download the data files, download or copy the scripts to your own machine and appropriate folder, and change the directory as needed to run the analysis.

This will allow us to raise the question about core collections: stratification-based or maximisation-based strategies ?
