## Using envirotyping data to assess population stucture

Using data from `WorldClim` repository and combining with genome admixture data, we will explore the population structure of a wild legume around the Mediterannean Basin.

This will allow us to raise the question about core collections: stratification-based or maximisation-based strategies ?
